    <div id="about-eclipse">
        <p>What you just witnessed is a total solar eclipse, but before we talk about that, let's understand what eclipses are. An eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon that occurs when a celestial body, such as the Moon or a planet, passes in front of another celestial body, thus partially or completely blocking the light from that celestial body that is being eclipsed. The most common eclipses are solar eclipses and lunar eclipses.</p>
        <p>Below you will find out more about the types of eclipses, keep scrolling down the page for more information about eclipses!</p>

<!-- Questions -->
        <h2 data-text="01. Why do only a few people on Earth see an eclipse at any given time?">01. Why do only a few people on Earth see an eclipse at any given time?</h2>
        <p>The visibility of an eclipse depends on several factors, some of which are:
            Geographic location: To see an eclipse, you must be in the hemisphere of Earth where it is visible at the time it occurs.
            Position of the Earth: The Earth is always rotating on its own axis and orbiting the Sun. This means that the relative position of celestial bodies is always changing and, with it, the possibility of seeing an eclipse.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 data-text="02. How does an eclipse occur?">02. How does an eclipse occur?</h2>
        <p>The Moon surrounds the Earth in an elliptical orbit, meaning it moves in an oval path around the Earth, while the Earth surrounds the Sun in an elliptical orbit. This means that the position of these bodies is constantly changing.
            Due to these orbital movements, occasionally the Moon, Earth and Sun align in a straight line, thus causing an eclipse.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 data-text="03. What is an eclipse season?">03. What is an eclipse season?</h2>
        <p>If the Moon's orbital plane corresponded directly to the ecliptic plane, a solar eclipse would occur every new Moon and a lunar eclipse every full Moon. However, the plane is tilted 5.2° and, therefore, the Moon needs to be close to the line of nodes (crossing the ecliptic plane) for an eclipse to occur. Because the Earth-Moon system orbits the Sun, approximately twice a year the line of nodes is aligned with the Sun and Earth. These are eclipse seasons, when eclipses can occur. When the Moon passes the node during eclipse season, an eclipse occurs.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 data-text="04. How does it affect our lives?">04. How does it affect our lives?</h2>
        <p>Wearing sunglasses is necessary when looking directly at the Sun, because direct light against the retina can cause severe damage to eye health, and even blindness, which can also happen when observing an eclipse.
           Total solar eclipses provide a favorable opportunity to study the Earth's atmosphere. In contrast to usual conditions, a solar eclipse changes the lighting over a certain region of the Earth. This blocking is useful for studying the Sun's effects on our atmosphere, where its energy creates a layer of charged particles called the ionosphere. Understanding this area is of great importance, as it is where several satellites, responsible for communication, radio waves and the GPS system, orbit.</p>
